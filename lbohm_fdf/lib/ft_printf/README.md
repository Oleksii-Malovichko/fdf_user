# Printf project
## Introduction
You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty.
You will discover variadic functions in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.
## Mandatory part
### You have to implement the following conversions:
+ %c Prints a single character.
+ %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
+ %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format. â€¢ %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
+ %i Prints an integer in base 10.
+ %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
+ %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
+ %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
+ %% Prints a percent sign.
